Normally, if you are not the Priority Target, you can break a combo as a reaction, by exhausting a valid combo-breaking weapon, but only if you are within its effective range. Each Primordial utilizing the combo mechanic has a Combo track that designates which Weapons can currently be used to break its combo. When you break a combo, simply move the token on the Combo track to the next space, without resolving the combo. Then gain the Priority Target token. Important: You cannot break a combo if you are the Priority Target! (and the Priority Target doesn't change with Rage gain in this battle.) Combo number: Primordials can usually preform a combo only once per Round. They may, however, perform a combo once in the Primordial Round, then once in the Titan Round, if any effect causes them to resolve an Al card during that Round. Chain breaks: A Chain Break during an Al card does not cancel a combo. The combo is a separate effect, triggered after you finish resolving an Al card, even if it was partially or fully invalidated by a different effect.
